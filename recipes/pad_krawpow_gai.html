            <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce,

            <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil.

            <li>Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the

            <li>Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet;
