        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="description">This type of curry is moderately spiced and one of the most versatile. 
            Red curry is made with several red chilies, which gives it a bold and spicy flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>coriander</li>
            <li>cumin</li>
            <li>red bell pepper</li>
            <li>red chile</li>
            <li>lemongrass</li>
            <li>ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add ginger and garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in red curry paste,
                 let sizzle for a few seconds, then pour in coconut milk. Bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Reduce to a simmer, stir a little, and wait for the oil to rise to the surface. Add chicken thighs and lime leaves and simmer until
                 the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the centers, about 12 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add fish sauce and brown sugar and taste--if you like it a little saltier, add more fish sauce; if you like it sweeter, add a little more sugar. </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then take off the heat and add Thai basil. </li>
            <li>Spoon the curry into a bowl. Serve with jasmine rice. </li>
        </ol>
